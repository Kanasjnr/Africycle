# AfriCycle: A Multi-Stream ReFi Waste Management Ecosystem

## 🌍 Overview
AfriCycle is a blockchain-powered circular economy platform that addresses Africa’s waste management crisis across three key waste streams: **plastic**, **electronic waste (e-waste)**, and **metal/general waste**. The platform incentivizes waste collection through **tokenized rewards**, enables **transparent recycling processes**, and promotes **corporate sustainability** through verified **recycling credits**.

## 🚀 Features
### ♻️ Multi-Stream Waste Collection
- **Plastic Waste**: QR-code-based verification and weight-based tracking.
- **E-Waste**: Detailed documentation of valuable components such as CPUs, batteries, and PCBs.
- **Metal & General Waste**: Categorization, weight-based verification, and quality assessment.

### 🔗 Blockchain-Based Verification
- **Decentralized authentication** of waste collection.
- **Immutable record-keeping** for recycling activities.
- **Transparent supply chain management**.

### 🎁 Tokenized Incentive System
- **Direct cryptocurrency payments** to collectors.
- **Tokenized environmental impact credits**.
- **Governance tokens** for platform participation.

### 🏪 Marketplace Ecosystem
- **Trading platform for recycled materials**.
- **Carbon/waste offset marketplace** for corporations.
- **Impact investment opportunities**.

## 🏗 Technical Architecture
### 🛠 Blockchain Infrastructure
AfriCycle is built on the **Celo blockchain** for:
- **Mobile-first design** (lightweight clients for low-end devices).
- **Low transaction costs** (gas fees <$0.001 per transaction).
- **Sustainable consensus** (Proof-of-Stake validation, carbon-negative infrastructure).


## 🏗 Application Architecture
### 🌐 Frontend Application
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** with offline capabilities.
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop access.
- **Push notifications** for transaction updates.

### 🖥 Backend Infrastructure
- **Node.js API** with Express.
- **MongoDB** for off-chain data storage.
- **Redis caching** for performance optimization.

### 📦 Blockchain Integration
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js** for smart contract interactions.
- **ContractKit** for Celo-specific features.
- **Metamask and Valora wallet integrations**.

### 🗄 Data Storage
- **IPFS** for decentralized media storage.
- **Ceramic Network** for decentralized identity.
- **MongoDB** for off-chain document storage.

## 🔄 Collection Process Details
### 🔹 Plastic Waste Collection
- Collectors gather PET bottles and recyclable plastics.
- QR codes on collection bags enable **batch verification**.
- Photo documentation for **manual verification**.
- **Weight-based validation** at collection centers.

### 🔹 E-Waste Collection
- Specialized collectors document **valuable electronic components**.
- Proper handling to prevent **hazardous material leakage**.
- **Component-based reward calculation**.

### 🔹 Metal/General Waste Collection
- Categorization into **ferrous, non-ferrous, and other materials**.
- **Weight-based verification** at recycling facilities.
- **Bulk collection incentives** for larger quantities.

## 💰 Revenue Model
### 🏦 Revenue Streams
- **Transaction Fees**
  - **1.5% fee** on marketplace transactions.
  - **0.5% fee** on token conversions (ACT to cUSD).
  - Volume-based discounts for high-frequency users.

## 📜 Smart Contract Implementation
- **ACT Token (AfriCycle Token)**: ERC-20 standard for incentives and payments.
- **Recycling NFTs**: ERC-721 impact certificates for verified waste processing.
- **Governance Model**: Decentralized voting via ERC-20 governance token.
