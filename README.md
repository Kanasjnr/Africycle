## üåç Overview
AfriCycle is a blockchain-powered circular economy platform that addresses Africa's waste management crisis across three key waste streams: **plastic**, **electronic waste (e-waste)**, and **metal/general waste**. The platform incentivizes waste collection through **tokenized rewards**, enables **transparent recycling processes**, and promotes **corporate sustainability** through verified **recycling credits**.

### üéØ Current Status
- **Live on Celo Mainnet** üü¢
- **Beta Testing Phase** üîÑ
- **Open for Early Adopters** üë•
- **Active Collection Points**: Multiple locations across Africa
- **Corporate Partnerships**: Growing network of sustainability-focused organizations
- **Verified Smart Contract**: [0xd8F399393958F5f29811b5786104cF90EfBeda41](https://celoscan.io/address/0xd8F399393958F5f29811b5786104cF90EfBeda41#code)

### Role-Based Workflow Description

1. **Waste Collector**
   - Delivers waste to collection points
   - Receives cUSD payments based on waste weight and type
   - Can track earnings through their wallet

2. **Collection Point**
   - Verifies and weighs incoming waste
   - Processes cUSD payments to collectors
   - Coordinates waste transfer to recyclers
   - Maintains quality standards

3. **Recycler**
   - Receives waste from collection points
   - Processes waste into recyclable materials
   - Creates NFTs for verified recycling
   - Sells recycling credits to corporate partners
   - Receives cUSD payments for credits

4. **Corporate Partner**
   - Purchases recycling credits using cUSD
   - Tracks environmental impact
   - Monitors sustainability goals
   - Accesses impact dashboard for reporting

### Key Interactions
- All financial transactions use cUSD
- NFTs represent verified recycling certificates
- Smart contracts automate payments and verification
- Impact tracking is transparent and immutable
