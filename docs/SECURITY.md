# üîí Security Documentation

## Overview

Africycle is a blockchain-powered waste management platform that handles financial transactions, environmental impact tracking, and user data. Given the financial and environmental implications of our platform, security is paramount. This document outlines our comprehensive security framework, audit processes, and vulnerability management procedures.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Framework

### Core Security Principles
